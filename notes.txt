Polling:

    client ➜ Server
        client repeatedly ask server after specific interval of time if there is update/data/response 
    
    - it is client-driven and time-based 

    e.g 
        - every 30 seconds, API hits ... /api/orders/status
        - server responds with current status

WebHooks:
    The server notifies the client automatically when an event happens.

    e.g 
        - Stripe sends a POST request to your server when payment succeeds
