Polling:

    mental model => client-driven + time-based 

    client ➜ Server
        client repeatedly ask server after specific interval of time if there is update/data/response 
    
    e.g 
        - every 30 seconds, API hits ... /api/orders/status
        - server responds with current status

.

Server sent events (SSE)
    
    server ➜ client only

    use case: 
        - news broadcasting
        - instagram lives 
        - sent notifications to multiple users, etc.

WebHooks:

    server ⇆ server
    
    mental model => Server-driven + Push-event

    (One-way communication)
    - Client registers a callback URL (URL, jhan server service puri hony pr ya event trigger hony pr response back kryga)
    - Event occurs
    - Server sends an HTTP POST
    - Connection closes

    The server notifies the client automatically when an event happens.

    e.g 
        - Stripe sends a POST request to your server when payment succeeds

WebSockets

    WebSocket itself is a protocol which canbe use with any language

    mental model => Server-driven + Push-event (bi-directional)

    client ⇆ server 
    server ⇆ server ==> only when one acts as a client
    
        - persistent and bi-directional communication network
        - once connected client and server communicate anytime
        - connection remains open
        - initiate by the client, terminates by the server
        
    complex to scale
        => sclable with brokers (e.g kafka, redis (not just DB also works as broker))

    Use cases:
        Chat apps
        real-time dashboards
        real-time collaborations (google docs)


    how it works:
        -- first, client send http handshake request to server with an "upgrade header"
        -- if server agrees, it replies with status code 101 (switching protocol response)
